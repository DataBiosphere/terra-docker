# Perform smoke tests on the terra-jupyter-aou Docker image to have some amount of confidence that
# Python package versions are compatible.
#
# To configure the minimal auth needed for these tests to be able to read public data from Google Cloud Platform:
# Step 1: Create a service account per these instructions:
#         https://github.com/google-github-actions/setup-gcloud/blob/master/setup-gcloud/README.md
# Step 2: Give the service account the following permissions within the project: BigQuery User
# Step 3: Store its key and project id as GitHub repository secrets GCP_SA_KEY and GCP_PROJECT_ID.
